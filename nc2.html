<!--Complete the below challenges using the Ninja Class from the previous assignment. 
    You may skip the functionality related to private variables.

const ninja1 = new Ninja("Hyabusa");
ninja1.sayName();
// -> "My ninja name is Hyabusa!"
ninja1.showStats();
// -> "Name: Hayabusa, Health: 100, Speed: 3, Strength: 3" 

.punch()
Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). 
This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. 
Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example

const blueNinja = new Ninja("Goemon");
const redNinja = new Ninja("Bill Gates");
redNinja.punch(blueNinja);
// -> "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!".

.kick()
Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, 
and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
blueNinja.kick(redNinja);
// -> "Bill Gates was kicked by Goemon and lost 15 Health!"

Validations
Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of the Ninja class. -->
